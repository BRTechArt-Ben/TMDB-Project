# TMDB-Project:

This was my end-of-module assignment for Programmatic Data Wrangling. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on a small but comprehensive movie dataset. The submission is a single Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file containing my entire exploration.

The notebook is annotated and code-commented for easy access and interpretation.

## Key Outcomes:

- Python visualisations to showcase my findings from the data.
- Identify two key points drawn from the data, explained through my code and findings. I noted what I found most interesting or surprising and explained why.
- Select two movies for in-depth single observation analysis (SOA). I explained my reasons for selecting these two movies and what I found interesting about them.
